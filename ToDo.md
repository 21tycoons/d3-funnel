# To-Do List

A list of ideas to add to the D3Funnel.

* Add the following configuration options:
	* `isPyramid`: Whether to invert the funnel chart to be a pyramid (or a flask in case of pinch!).
* Allow for color gradient darkness settings.
* Allow for coloring.
* Make it to where the text can be placed in a legend?

# Goals

* Fully cross platform for latest two major browser revisions.
* jQuery independent.
* JSHint compliant.
* Unit testable (later).
